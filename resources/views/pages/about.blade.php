The story doesn’t deviate much from any other Artist biography you may have read...

… so what make IMANI someone you want to know about? What makes him stand out?

The MAN! that’s what it is. After much debate and numerous drafts from creative writers, we here at The Stellar Factory have narrowed down his many attributes to the core, his essence.

Okay great! So he has a magnetic personality, that works for Chris Brown and many others, but alas the Man has talent. The songs, the concepts, the flow… you need to listen for yourself.

What do you really need to know right now!? Well.. his debut single, “COUNTERFEIT” is now available everwhere on-line. Co-written by Natario 'King' Johnson and produced by Torrance 'Street Symphony' Esmond for Track or Die. This is indeed an introduction of what's about to hit the industry. Already getting catch phrases thrown at it, like, “SMASH HIT”, “CLUB BANGER”. Affirmation
