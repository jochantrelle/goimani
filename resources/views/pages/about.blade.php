<span class="point-break">What do you really need to know right now!? Well.. his debut single, “COUNTERFEIT” is now available everwhere on-line. Co-written by Natario 'King' Johnson and produced by Torrance 'Street Symphony' Esmond for Track or Die. This is indeed an introduction of what's about to hit the industry. Already getting catch phrases thrown at it, like, “SMASH HIT”, “CLUB BANGER”.</span> <span class="point-break">Affirmation!</span>
